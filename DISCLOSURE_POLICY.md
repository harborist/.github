# Public Security Disclosure Policy
Harboristâ€™s guidelines and procedures for reporting, handling, and disclosing security vulnerabilities in their supported open source software products.

We are committed to ensuring the security and compatibility of the open source software we maintain. We value transparency and collaboration in addressing security issues to ensure the safety and integrity of the wider ecosystem.

## Scope

Our security disclosure policies apply to the following:

 - all projects listed under https://npmjs.com/~ljharb
 - https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm

## Identifying and Reporting Vulnerabilities

We encourage security researchers, developers, and users to report any security vulnerabilities discovered in our software promptly and responsibly.

## Please Do

Send an email to ljharb+harborist@gmail.com with the subject line: "Security Vulnerability Report - $ProjectName"
Include any relevant supporting materials, such as proof-of-concept code or screenshots
If possible, provide suggestions for mitigation or remediation of the vulnerability
Wait for a response from our security team. As some vulnerabilities take longer than others to investigate and resolve we will aim to have an open line of communication throughout the process.

## Please Do Not

 - Publicly disclose the vulnerability until assessment and remediation are complete and communicated
 - Exploit vulnerabilities in a way that harms customers or the open source community
 - Submit sensitive or privileged information. If such information needs to be shared as part of the reproduction and/or disclosure, please describe the information and wait to receive instructions to securely transfer the information

## Response Time

Upon receiving a vulnerability report, our security team will acknowledge the receipt of the report within 7 business days. We will then assess the reported vulnerability and its potential impact on the software we support.

Our goal is to provide timely updates on the status of the reported vulnerability and any planned remediation efforts. However, the actual response time may vary depending on the complexity of the issue and other factors.

## Contact Information

We reserve the right to update or modify this security disclosure policy at any time without prior notice.
